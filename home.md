### Analysis Steps:
- **Data Analysis**: Examine box office and critical reception data (e.g., IMDb scores, Metascores) by genre across decades.

- **Correlation Study**: Assess if certain genres thrive in specific eras (e.g., sci-fi in technological booms).

### Deliverables:
- Heatmap or line charts of genre trends over decades.
- Case study of specific genres (e.g., rise of superhero movies or resurgence of horror in the 2010s).
