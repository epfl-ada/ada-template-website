title: Blockbusters and Busts: Unpacking the Gap Between Critics and Cash
description: The existence of the Transformers movie franchise raises a curious question: how can films that critics pan become massive box office successes, while critically acclaimed gems sometimes struggle commercially? This project explores the divide between critical and financial success in cinema - or what makes them over/underperform in general when their critics ratings should predict otherwise - aiming to uncover what drives these differences. Weâ€™ll examine correlations between IMDb ratings and box office revenue to reveal general trends and identify outliers. Using a range of methodologies, from time-based and genre-specific analyses to sentiment analysis on plot summaries, we aim to uncover patterns across genres, timeframes, and film attributes. Our approach integrates dataset merging, inflation-adjusted revenue comparisons, outlier classification, distribution analysis, and advanced sentiment modeling to answer our research questions and provide insight into this complex relationship between critics and audiences.
